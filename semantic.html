                    <li>I am inside of a ul tag , which in turn is inside of a nav tag which in turn is inside of a header tag</li>
                    <li>why unordered list ? , coz order doesn't matter for nav items . this is not a top 10 list </li>
                    <li>li : I am the only valid inside of a ul . so  </li>
                    <li>truth is , there can be multiple nav's in one page</li>

            <p>I am the Main Section . I contain the purpose of the page</p>
            <p>this is the first thing a screen reader will look for</p>
            <p>there can only be one MAIN per page</p>

            <article>
                <p>I am an Article . I am the Premier Sectioning Content</p>

                        <li>Publish date etc</li>
                        <li>btw , you're looking at an ordered list at the moment . see the numbers??</li>
                    </ol>
                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>article can have a section ...multiple sections tbh , nobody gives a fck</p>
                </section>
                <aside>
                    <p>I am an Aside tag . I may be unfamiliar to ya</p>
                    <p>I hold content that's related to the article</p>
                    <p>but I am conisdered standalone. so even if you put me<strong> aside</strong> , the article would still make perfect sense</p>
                    <p>apart from that I can also contain</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>a pull quote from the main article like : </p>
                            <blockquote>quote for now</blockquote>
                        </li>
                        <li>author's biography</li>
                        <li>meaning of jargons used in the main article</li>
                        <li>etc</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Look, I know you're not following what I'm saying anyway, right?</p>
                    <p>That's... that's okay, that doesn't matter</p>
                    <p>The real question is this: is the usage of aside mandatory?</p>
                    <img src="https://media.tenor.com/sM-7HaE3Xb0AAAAe/no-no-no.png"/>
                    <p>That was the img tag in action . more about it later</p>
                </aside>
                <article>
                    <p>I am a comment and I live inside an article</p>
                    <p>that's right it means you can nest articles</p>
                    <p>and comment is an article , coz it can standalone without needing any context from the page</p>
                    <p>how many more fit into the criteria of articles?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>blog post</li>
                        <li>forum post</li>
                        <li>product card</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>
                <footer>
                    <p>I am the footer of the article</p>
                    <p>yes , an article can contain a footer . more about footer later</p>
                    <p>inside an article I can hold</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>tags/categories</li>
                        <li>read-more links</li>
                        <li>no of user comments</li>
                    </ul>
                </footer>
            </article>
            
            <section>
                <p>I'm the section again</p>
                <p>use me when you need to split your main content into multiple related groups</p>
                <p>I need the context of the main page to make sense</p>
                <p>I also need a heading to make sense</p>
                <p>so if you remove me from the current document outline , I'll make 0 sense . NADA</p>
